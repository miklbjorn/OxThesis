The work presented in this thesis has been resulted in two papers, either under review or published in the Journal of High Energy Physics. These are
\begin{itemize}

    \item [] \cite{GGSZ-B2Dh} \emph{Measurement of the CKM angle $\gamma$ using $\Bpm\to [\KS h^+h^-]_\D h^\pm$ decays}, submitted to JHEP. \\
    This paper describes a measurement of the CKM angle $\gamma$ using $pp$ collision data taken with the LHCb experiment during the Run~1 of the LHC, in 2011 and 2012, and during the full Run~2, in 2015--2018. The measurement uses the decay channels $\Bpm\to\D h^\pm$ where $\D\to\KS h'^+h'^-$, in which $h$ and $h'$ denotes pions or kaons. It obtains a value of $\gamma = (69\pm5)^\circ$, which constitutes the world's best single-measurement determination of $\gamma$. The work is the main focus of this thesis and described in detail in Chapter~\ref{ch:5-GGSZ-measurement}.

    \item [] \cite{KsCPV} \emph{CP violation and material interaction of neutral kaons
                        in measurements of the CKM angle $\gamma$ using $B^\pm\to
                        DK^\pm$ decays where $D\to K_\text{S}^0\pi^+\pi^-$}, JHEP 19 (2020) 106. \\
                        This paper describes a phenomenological study of the impact of neutral kaon \CP violation and material interaction on measurements of $\gamma$. With the increased measurement precision to come in the near future, an understanding of these effects is crucial, especially in the context of $\B\to\D\pi$ decays; however no detailed study had been published at the start of this thesis. The study is the subject of Chapter~\ref{ch:4-KS-CPV}. Some text excerpts and figures from the paper have been reproduced in the thesis.
\end{itemize}
All of the work described in this thesis is my own, except where clearly referenced to others. Furthermore, I contributed significantly to an analysis of $\Bpm\to\D\Kpm$ decays with LHCb data taken in 2015 and 2016, now published in
\begin{itemize}
    \item [] \cite{LHCb-PAPER-2018-017} \emph{Measurement of the CKM angle $\gamma$ using \decay{\Bpm}{DK^\pm} with \decay{D}{\KS \pi^+ \pi^-} $\KS K^+K^-$ decays}, JHEP 08 (2018) 176.
\end{itemize}
I was responsible for the analysis of the signal channel, systematic studies, and the interpretation. The measurement is superseded by that of Ref.~\cite{GGSZ-B2Dh} and is not described in detail in the thesis.
