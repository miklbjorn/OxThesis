  abstract = {The precise determination of the Cabibbo\textendash Kobayashi\textendash Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements is extremely important towards the understanding of CP violation. We explicitly study seeming discrepancies between the CKM matrix elements at the higher order of the expansion parameter {$\lambda$} in different Wolfenstein parametrizations derived from different exact parametrizations. A systematic way of resolving the seeming discrepancies is proposed. We find that most of the discrepancies can be naturally resolved by a proper redefinition of the numerically small (of order {$\lambda$}) parameters. Our approach is further applied to the cases for the Wolfenstein-like parametrizations, such as the Qin\textendash Ma parametrization.},

  abstract = {We give a classical confidence belt construction which unifies the treatment of upper confidence limits for null results and two-sided confidence intervals for non-null results. The unified treatment solves a problem (apparently not previously recognized) that the choice of upper limit or two-sided intervals leads to intervals which are not confidence intervals if the choice is based on the data. We apply the construction to two related problems which have recently been a battle-ground between classical and Bayesian statistics: Poisson processes with background, and Gaussian errors with a bounded physical region. In contrast with the usual classical construction for upper limits, our construction avoids unphysical confidence intervals. In contrast with some popular Bayesian intervals, our intervals eliminate conservatism (frequentist coverage greater than the stated confidence) in the Gaussian case and reduce it to a level dictated by discreteness in the Poisson case. We generalize the method in order to apply it to analysis of experiments searching for neutrino oscillations. We show that this technique both gives correct coverage and is powerful, while other classical techniques that have been used by neutrino oscillation search experiments fail one or both of these criteria.},

  abstract = {A binned Dalitz plot analysis of \$B\^\textbackslash pm \textbackslash to D K\^\textbackslash pm\$ decays, with \$D \textbackslash to K\_S \textbackslash pi\^+\textbackslash pi\^-\$ and \$D \textbackslash to K\_S K\^+ K\^-\$, is performed to measure the \textbackslash CP-violating observables \$x\_\{\textbackslash pm\}\$ and \$y\_\{\textbackslash pm\}\$, which are sensitive to the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa angle \$\textbackslash gamma\$. The analysis exploits a sample of proton-proton collision data corresponding to 3.0\textbackslash invfb collected by the LHCb experiment. Measurements from CLEO-c of the variation of the strong-interaction phase of the \$D\$ decay over the Dalitz plot are used as inputs. The values of the parameters are found to be \$x\_+ = (-7.7 \textbackslash pm 2.4 \textbackslash pm 1.0 \textbackslash pm 0.4)\textbackslash times 10\^\{-2\}\$, \$x\_- = (2.5 \textbackslash pm 2.5 \textbackslash pm 1.0 \textbackslash pm 0.5) \textbackslash times 10\^\{-2\}\$, \$y\_+ = (-2.2 \textbackslash pm 2.5 \textbackslash pm 0.4 \textbackslash pm 1.0)\textbackslash times 10\^\{-2\}\$, and \$y\_- = (7.5 \textbackslash pm 2.9 \textbackslash pm 0.5 \textbackslash pm 1.4) \textbackslash times 10\^\{-2\}\$. The first, second, and third uncertainties are the statistical, the experimental systematic, and that associated with the precision of the strong-phase parameters. These are the most precise measurements of these observables and correspond to \$\textbackslash gamma = (62\^\{\textbackslash,+15\}\_\{\textbackslash,-14\})\^\textbackslash circ\$, with a second solution at \$\textbackslash gamma \textbackslash to \textbackslash gamma + 180\^\textbackslash circ\$, and \$r\_B = 0.080\^\{+ 0.019\}\_\{-0.021\}\$, where \$r\_B\$ is the ratio between the suppressed and favoured \$B\$ decay amplitudes.},

  abstract = {A binned Dalitz plot analysis of \$B\^\textbackslash pm \textbackslash to D K\^\textbackslash pm\$ decays, with \$D \textbackslash to K\_S \textbackslash pi\^+\textbackslash pi\^-\$ and \$D \textbackslash to K\_S K\^+ K\^-\$, is performed to measure the \textbackslash CP-violating observables \$x\_\{\textbackslash pm\}\$ and \$y\_\{\textbackslash pm\}\$, which are sensitive to the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa angle \$\textbackslash gamma\$. The analysis exploits a sample of proton-proton collision data corresponding to 3.0\textbackslash invfb collected by the LHCb experiment. Measurements from CLEO-c of the variation of the strong-interaction phase of the \$D\$ decay over the Dalitz plot are used as inputs. The values of the parameters are found to be \$x\_+ = (-7.7 \textbackslash pm 2.4 \textbackslash pm 1.0 \textbackslash pm 0.4)\textbackslash times 10\^\{-2\}\$, \$x\_- = (2.5 \textbackslash pm 2.5 \textbackslash pm 1.0 \textbackslash pm 0.5) \textbackslash times 10\^\{-2\}\$, \$y\_+ = (-2.2 \textbackslash pm 2.5 \textbackslash pm 0.4 \textbackslash pm 1.0)\textbackslash times 10\^\{-2\}\$, and \$y\_- = (7.5 \textbackslash pm 2.9 \textbackslash pm 0.5 \textbackslash pm 1.4) \textbackslash times 10\^\{-2\}\$. The first, second, and third uncertainties are the statistical, the experimental systematic, and that associated with the precision of the strong-phase parameters. These are the most precise measurements of these observables and correspond to \$\textbackslash gamma = (62\^\{\textbackslash,+15\}\_\{\textbackslash,-14\})\^\textbackslash circ\$, with a second solution at \$\textbackslash gamma \textbackslash to \textbackslash gamma + 180\^\textbackslash circ\$, and \$r\_B = 0.080\^\{+ 0.019\}\_\{-0.021\}\$, where \$r\_B\$ is the ratio between the suppressed and favoured \$B\$ decay amplitudes.},
