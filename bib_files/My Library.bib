We identify W bosons by their decays to e{$\nu$} final states. We extract the W mass MW by fitting the transverse mass and transverse electron momentum spectra from a sample of 28 323 W{$\vec$} e{$\nu$} decay candidates. We use a sample of 3563 dielectron events, mostly due to Z{$\vec$} ee decays, to constrain our model of the detector response. From the transverse mass fit we measure MW=80.44{$\pm$}0.10(stat){$\pm$}0.07(syst) GeV. Combining this with our previously published result from data taken in 1992\textendash 1993, we obtain MW=80.43{$\pm$}0.11GeV.},

On the other hand, in the reaction \$\textbackslash gamma\textbackslash gamma\textbackslash to W\^+W\^-\$ the effect of the non-resonant graphs is large everywhere, due to the \$t\$-channel pole.

The combined data set considered in this report corresponds to a total luminosity of about 3 fb\$\^\{-1\}\$ collected by the four LEP experiments ALEPH, DELPHI, L3 and OPAL, at centre-of-mass energies ranging from 130 GeV to 209 GeV. Combining the published results of the four LEP experiments, the measurements include total and differential cross-sections in photon-pair, fermion-pair and four-fermion production, the latter resulting from both double-resonant WW and ZZ production as well as singly resonant production. Total and differential cross-sections are measured precisely, providing a stringent test of the Standard Model at centre-of-mass energies never explored before in electron-positron collisions. Final-state interaction effects in four-fermion production, such as those arising from colour reconnection and Bose-Einstein correlations between the two W decay systems arising in WW production, are searched for and upper limits on the strength of possible effects are obtained. The data are used to determine fundamental properties of the W boson and the electroweak theory. Among others, the mass and width of the W boson, \$M\_W\$ and \$\textbackslash Gamma\_W\$, the branching fraction of W decays to hadrons, \$B(W\textbackslash to\textbackslash mathrm\{had\})\$, and the trilinear gauge-boson self-couplings \$g\^Z\_1\$, \$\textbackslash kappa\_\textbackslash gamma\$ and \$\textbackslash lambda\_\textbackslash gamma\$ are determined to be: M\_W = 80.376 \textbackslash pm 0.033 \textasciitilde GeV \textbackslash Gamma\_W = 2.195 \textbackslash pm 0.083 \textasciitilde GeV B(W\textbackslash to\textbackslash mathrm\{had\}) = 67.41 \textbackslash pm 0.27 \% g\^Z\_1 = 0.984 \^\{+0.018\}\_\{-0.020\} \textbackslash kappa\_\textbackslash gamma = 0.982 \textbackslash pm 0.042 \textbackslash lambda\_\textbackslash gamma = -0.022 \textbackslash pm 0.019},

  abstract = {We calculate the gauge terms of the one-loop anomalous dimension matrix for the dimension-six operators of the Standard Model effective field theory (SM EFT). Combining these results with our previous results for the \$\textbackslash lambda\$ and Yukawa coupling terms completes the calculation of the one-loop anomalous dimension matrix for the dimension-six operators. There are 1350 \$CP\$-even and \$1149\$ \$CP\$-odd parameters in the dimension-six Lagrangian for 3 generations, and our results give the entire \$2499 \textbackslash times 2499\$ anomalous dimension matrix. We discuss how the renormalization of the dimension-six operators, and the additional renormalization of the dimension \$d \textbackslash le 4\$ terms of the SM Lagrangian due to dimension-six operators, lays the groundwork for future precision studies of the SM EFT aimed at constraining the effects of new physics through precision measurements at the electroweak scale. As some sample applications, we discuss some aspects of the full RGE improved result for essential processes such as \$gg \textbackslash to h\$, \$h \textbackslash to \textbackslash gamma \textbackslash gamma\$ and \$h \textbackslash to Z \textbackslash gamma\$, for Higgs couplings to fermions, for the precision electroweak parameters \$S\$ and \$T\$, and for the operators that modify important processes in precision electroweak phenomenology, such as the three-body Higgs boson decay \$h \textbackslash rightarrow Z \textbackslash, \textbackslash ell\^+ \textbackslash, \textbackslash ell\^-\$ and triple gauge boson couplings. We discuss how the renormalization group improved results can be used to study the flavor problem in the SM EFT, and to test the minimal flavor violation (MFV) hypothesis. We briefly discuss the renormalization effects on the dipole coefficient \$C\_\{e\textbackslash gamma\}\$ which contributes to \$\textbackslash mu \textbackslash to e \textbackslash gamma\$ and to the muon and electron magnetic and electric dipole moments.},

  abstract = {Effective Lagrangians can be used to parametrize the effects of physics beyond the standard model. Assuming the complete theory is a gauge theory, we determine which effective operators may be generated at tree level, and which are only generated at loop level. The latter are be suppressed by factors of \$1/ 16\textbackslash pi\^2\$ and will therefore be quite difficult to detect. In particular, all operators changing the Standard-Model structure of the triple-gauge-vector couplings fall into this category. We also point out that in certain cases, dimension-eight operators may be more important than dimension-six operators. We discuss both the linear and non-linear representation of the Higgs sector.},

Numerous aspects of the formalism are reviewed at the O({$\alpha$}2S) level, including the matching of the QT distribution and the value of the total cross section. Detailed comparisons of several O({$\alpha$}S) fixed order (NLO) and resummed lepton distributions are presented. The total rates and the distributions of the lepton charge asymmetry predicted by the resummed and the NLO calculations are shown to differ when kinematic cuts are applied. We also show how to test the rich dynamics of the QCD multiple soft gluon radiation, among others by measuring the ratio RCSS{$\equiv\sigma$}(QT{$>$}QminT)/{$\sigma$}total.},

Those readers who manage to battle through the barrage of transverse notation distinguishing ``{$\top$}'' from ``{$\vee$}'' or from ``{$\circ$},'' and ``early projection'' from ``late projection,'' will find their efforts rewarded towards the end of the paper with (i) a better understanding of how collider mass variables fit together, (ii) an appreciation of how these variables could be generalized to search for things more complicated than supersymmetry, (iii) will depart with an aversion to thoughtless or na\"ive use of the so-called transverse methods of any of the popular computer Lorentz-vector libraries, and (iv) will take care in their subsequent papers to be explicit about which of the 61 identified variants of the ``transverse mass'' they are employing.},

The so-called double-pole approximation offers a way out of these problems. This method is applied to the reaction \$e\^\{+\}e\^\{-\} \textbackslash to W\^\{+\}W\^\{-\} \textbackslash to 4 \$fermions, which allows us to address all the key issues of dealing with unstable particles, like gauge invariance, interactions between different stages of the reaction, and overlapping resonances. Within the double-pole approximation the complete \$\textbackslash OO(\textbackslash alpha)\$ electroweak corrections are evaluated for this off-shell \$W\$-pair production process. Examples of the effect of these corrections on a number of distributions are presented. These comprise mass and angular distributions as well as the photon-energy spectrum.},

We demonstrate that previously neglected corrections scale as \$\textbackslash Gamma\_Z M\_Z/\textbackslash bar\{v\}\_T\^2\$ in the partial widths extracted from measured cross sections at LEPI, compared to the leading effect of dimension six operators in anomalous \$Z\$ couplings. Further, constraints on leading effects of anomalous \$Z\$ couplings are also modified by neglected perturbative corrections and dimension eight operators. We perform a minimal EWPD fit to illustrate the size of the error these corrections induce, when bounding leading effects. These considerations relax bounds compared to a naive leading order analysis, and show that constraints that rise above the percent level are subject to substantial theoretical uncertanties. We also argue that renormalization group running global constraints expressed through \$\textbackslash chi\^2\$ functions to a common scale, and then minimizing and performing a global fit of all data allows more consistent constraints to be obtained in the SMEFT.},

  abstract = {Whether one starts from the analytic S-matrix definition or the requirement of gauge-parameter independence in renormalization theory, a relativistic resonance is given by a pole at a complex value sR of the energy squared s. The complex number sR does not define the mass and the width separately, and the pole definition alone is also not sufficient to describe the interference of two or more Breit-Wigner resonances as observed in experiments. To achieve this and obtain a unified theory of relativistic resonances and decay, we invoke the decaying particle aspect of a resonance and associate to each pole a space of relativistic Gamow kets. The Gamow kets transform irreducibly under causal Poincar\'e transformations and have an exponential time evolution. Therefore one can choose of the many possible width parameters, the width {$\Gamma$}R of the relativistic resonance such that the lifetime {$\tau$}={$\hslash$}/{$\Gamma$}R. This leads to the parametrization sR=(MR-i{$\Gamma$}R/2)2 and uniquely defines these (MR,{$\Gamma$}R) as the mass and width parameters for a resonance. Further it leads to the following new results: Two poles in the same partial wave are given by the sum of two Breit-Wigner amplitudes and by a superposition of two Gamow vectors with each Gamow vector corresponding to one Breit-Wigner amplitude. In addition to the sum of Breit-Wigner amplitudes, the scattering amplitude contains a background amplitude representing direct production of the final state (contact terms). This contact amplitude is associated to a background vector representing the nonexponential energy continuum; omitting it gives the two interfering exponentials of the Weisskopf-Wigner methods. To accomplish all this required a minor modification in the foundation of quantum theory, which led to a quantum theory that contains the time asymmetry of causality.},

Radiation damping due to the emission of {$\gamma$}-rays broadens the resonance and reduces scattering in comparison with absorption by a large factor. Interaction with the nucleus is most probable through the s part of the incident wave. The higher the resonance region, the smaller will be the absorption. For a resonance region at 50 volts the cross section at resonance may be as high as 10-19 cm2 and 0.5\texttimes 10-20 cm2 at thermal energy. The estimated probability of having a nuclear level in the low energy region is sufficiently high to make the explanation reasonable. Temperature effects and absorption of filtered radiation point to the existence of bands which fit in with the present theory.},

We first show that this master formula follows immediately from the concept of chiral dimensions (loop counting), together with standard dimensional analysis. Subsequently, [1] has disputed the relevance of chiral counting for chiral Lagrangians, and in particular for the electroweak chiral Lagrangian including a light Higgs boson. As an alternative, a power counting based on `primary dimensions' has been proposed. The difficulties encountered with this scheme led the authors to suggest that even the leading order of the electroweak chiral Lagrangian could not be clearly defined. Here we demonstrate that the concept of primary dimensions is irrelevant for the organization of chiral Lagrangians. We re-emphasize that the correct counting is based on chiral dimensions, or the counting of loop orders, and show how the problems encountered in [1] are resolved.},

  abstract = {New interactions with a scale {$\Lambda$} larger than the Fermi scale GF-12 will manifest themselves at energies below {$\Lambda$} through small deviations from the standard model, which can be described by an effective lagrangian containing non-renormalizable SU(3) \texttimes{} SU(2) \texttimes{} U(1) invariant operators. We construct the first two terms of this lagrangian in an expansion in powers of 1/{$\Lambda$} and study systematically possible effects of new interactions such as anomalous magnetic moments, deviations from universality in weak interactions and rare processes. Among the flavour conserving processes the universality of the charged current weak interactions yields the strongest bound on the new interaction scale, {$\Lambda$} \&gt; 5 TeV, whereas flavour non-conserving processes imply the bound {$\Lambda$} \&gt; 3000 TeV. We derive conditions for natural flavour conservation. Although it cannot be excluded that all flavour changing operators are dynamically suppressed, this appears difficult to understand without a symmetry for which the standard electroweak theory seems to provide no hint. We emphasize the importance of searching for rare decays of D-mesons.},

  abstract = {Using effective-lagrangian techniques we perform a systematic survey of the lowest-dimension effective interactions through which heavy physics might manifest itself in present experiments. We do not restrict ourselves to special classes of effective interactions (such as `oblique' corrections). We compute the effects of these operators on all currently well-measured electroweak observables, both at low energies and at the \$Z\$ resonance, and perform a global fit to their coefficients. Despite the fact that a great many operators arise in our survey, we find that most are quite strongly bounded by the current data. We use our survey to systematically identify those effective interactions which are \{\textbackslash it not\} well-bounded by the data -- these could very well include large new-physics contributions. Our results may also be used to efficiently confront specific models for new physics with the data, as we illustrate with an example.},

We generalise previous results to include broader classes of UV models, showing how expressions previously obtained assuming degenerate heavy-particle masses can be extended to non-degenerate cases. We apply our method to the general MSSM with non-degenerate stop squarks, illustrating our approach with calculations of the coefficients of dimension-6 operators contributing to the \$hgg\$ and \$h\textbackslash gamma\textbackslash gamma\$ couplings, and comparing with exact calculations of one-loop Feynman diagrams. We then use present and projected future sensitivities to these operator coefficients to obtain present and possible future indirect constraints on stop masses. The current sensitivity is already comparable to that of direct LHC searches, and future FCC-ee measurements could be sensitive to stop masses above a TeV. The universality of our one-loop EFT approach facilitates extending these constraints to a broader class of UV models.},

We consider the constraints imposed on the coefficients of dimension-6 operators by electroweak precision tests (EWPTs), applying a framework for the effects of dimension-6 operators on electroweak precision tests that is more general than the standard \$S,T\$ formalism, and use measurements of Higgs couplings and the kinematics of associated Higgs production at the Tevatron and LHC, as well as triple-gauge couplings at the LHC. We highlight the complementarity between EWPTs, Tevatron and LHC measurements in obtaining model-independent limits on the effective Standard Model after LHC Run\textasciitilde 1.

This framework allows for a systematic inclusion of off-shell and non-factorizable effects whilst at the same time keeping the computational effort minimal compared to a full calculation in the complex-mass scheme. As a proof-of-concept example, we give results for an NLO calculation of top-antitop production in the \$q \textbackslash bar\{q\}\$ partonic channel. As already found in a similar calculation of single-top production, the finite-width effects are small for the total cross section, as expected from the na\textbackslash " ive counting \$\textbackslash sim \textbackslash Gamma\_t/m\_t \textbackslash sim 1\%\$. However, they can be sizeable, in excess of 10\%, close to edges of certain kinematical distributions. The dependence of the results on the mass renormalization scheme, and its implication for a precise extraction of the top-quark mass, is also discussed.},

The unified treatment solves a problem (apparently not previously recognized) that the choice of upper limit or two-sided intervals leads to intervals which are not confidence intervals if the choice is based on the data. We apply the construction to two related problems which have recently been a battle-ground between classical and Bayesian statistics: Poisson processes with background, and Gaussian errors with a bounded physical region. In contrast with the usual classical construction for upper limits, our construction avoids unphysical confidence intervals. In contrast with some popular Bayesian intervals, our intervals eliminate conservatism (frequentist coverage greater than the stated confidence) in the Gaussian case and reduce it to a level dictated by discreteness in the Poisson case. We generalize the method in order to apply it to analysis of experiments searching for neutrino oscillations. We show that this technique both gives correct coverage and is powerful, while other classical techniques that have been used by neutrino oscillation search experiments fail one or both of these criteria.},

In addition, the full kinematic distribution of the decay products can be reconstructed, which, nonetheless, is not taken into account in traditional search strategy relying only on measurements of the total invariant mass. In this work we implement a type of multivariate analysis known as the matrix element method, which exploits differences in the full production and decay matrix elements between the Higgs boson and the dominant irreducible background from q bar\{q\} -{$>$} ZZ*. Analytic expressions of the differential distributions for both the signal and the background are also presented. We perform a study for the Large Hadron Collider at sqrt\{s\}=7 TeV for Higgs masses between 175 and 350 GeV. We find that, with an integrated luminosity of 2.5 fb\^-1 or higher, improvements in the order of 10 - 20 \% could be obtained for both discovery significance and exclusion limits in the high mass region, where the differences in the angular correlations between signal and background are most pronounced.},

  abstract = {New physics beyond the standard model (SM) can be formulated via dimension-6 effective operators, whose coefficients (cutoffs) characterize the scales of new physics. We study the probe of new physics scales from the electroweak precision observables (EWPO) and the Higgs observables (HO) at the future \$e\^+e\^-\$ Higgs Factory (such as CEPC). To optimize constraints of new physics from all available observables, we establish a scheme-independent approach. With this formulation, we treat the SM electroweak parameters and the coefficients of dimension-6 operators on equal footing, which can be fitted simultaneously by the same \$\textbackslash chi\^2\$ function. As deviations from the SM are generally small, we can expand the new physics parameters up to linear order and perform an analytical \$\textbackslash chi\^2\$ fit to derive the potential reach of the new physics scales. We find that the HO (from both Higgs produnction and decay rates) can probe the new physics scales up to 10TeV (and to 40TeV for the case of gluon-involved operator \$\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}\_g\$), and including the EWPO can further push the limit up to \$35\$TeV. From this prospect, we demonstrate that the \$Z\$-pole measurements in the early phase of a Higgs Factory can be as important as the Higgs observables. These indirect probes of new physics scales at the Higgs Factory can mainly cover the energy range to be explored by the next generation hadron colliders of \$pp\$(50-100TeV), such as the SPPC and FCC-hh.},

Dimension-six terms have been enumerated in the classical article by Buchmueller and Wyler [3]. Although redundance of some of those operators has been already noted in the literature, no updated complete list has been published to date. Here we perform their classification once again from the outset. Assuming baryon number conservation, we find 15 + 19 + 25 = 59 independent operators (barring flavour structure and Hermitian conjugations), as compared to 16 + 35 + 29 = 80 in Ref.[3]. The three summed numbers refer to operators containing 0, 2 and 4 fermion fields. If the assumption of baryon number conservation is relaxed, 5 new operators arise in the four-fermion sector.},

  abstract = {In this work, we explore an extension of Hilbert series techniques to count operators that include derivatives. For sufficiently low-derivative operators, we find an algorithm that gives the number of invariant operators, properly accounting for redundancies due to the equations of motion and integration by parts. Specifically, the technique can be applied whenever there is only one Lorentz invariant for a given partitioning of derivatives among the fields. At higher numbers of derivatives, equation of motion redundancies can be removed, but the increased number of Lorentz contractions spoils the subtraction of integration by parts redundancies. While restricted, this technique is sufficient to automatically generate the complete set of invariant operators of the Standard Model effective field theory for dimensions 6 and 7 (for arbitrary numbers of flavors). At dimension 8, the algorithm does not automatically generate the complete operator set; however, it suffices for all but five classes of operators. For these remaining classes, there is a well defined procedure to manually determine the number of invariants. Using these methods, we thereby derive the set of 535 dimension-8 \$N\_f = 1\$ operators.},

The momentum scale is calibrated with J/psi -{$>$} mu+mu- decays and verified to be known to a relative precision of 2 x 10\^-4 using other two-body decays. The results are more precise than previous measurements, particularly in the case of the B0\_s and Lambda\_b masses.},

The analysis exploits a sample of proton-proton collision data corresponding to 3.0\textbackslash invfb collected by the LHCb experiment.

  abstract = {Even though the Standard Model (SM) is weakly coupled at the Fermi scale, a new strong dynamics involving its degrees of freedom may conceivably lurk at slightly higher energies, in the multi TeV range. Approximate symmetries provide a structurally robust context where, within the low energy description, the dimensionless SM couplings are weak, while the new strong dynamics manifests itself exclusively through higher-derivative interactions. We present an exhaustive classification of such scenarios in the form of effective field theories, paying special attention to new classes of models where the strong dynamics involves, along with the Higgs boson, the SM gauge bosons and/or the fermions. The IR softness of the new dynamics suppresses its effects at LEP energies, but deviations are in principle detectable at the LHC, even at energies below the threshold for production of new states. Our construction provides the so far unique structurally robust context where to motivate several searches in Higgs physics, diboson production, or WW scattering, which were so far poorly justified. Perhaps surprisingly, the interplay between weak coupling, strong coupling and derivatives, which is controlled by symmetries, can override the naive expansion in operator dimension, providing instances where dimension-8 dominates dimension-6, well within the domain of validity of the low energy effective theory. This result reveals the limitations of an analysis that is both ambitiously general and restricted to dimension-6 operators.},

An important input to the measurement comes from the use of D\textrightarrow KS0{$\pi$}+{$\pi-$} and D\textrightarrow KL0{$\pi$}+{$\pi-$} decays to tag the signal mode. This same technique is applied to the channels D\textrightarrow{$\pi$}+{$\pi-\pi$}0 and D\textrightarrow K+K-{$\pi$}0, yielding F+{$\pi\pi\pi$}0=1.014{$\pm$}0.045{$\pm$}0.022 and F+KK{$\pi$}0=0.734{$\pm$}0.106{$\pm$}0.054, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic.

It is shown that predictions of the complete theory, renormalized by means of dimensional regularization with nonminimal subtraction, coincide with those of the local effective field theory with dimension at most four, renormalized by dimensional regularization and minimal subtraction. It is also shown that the renormalization-group equations for low-momenta light-particle processes, as described by the complete theory and the local effective field theory, are identical-a nontrivial result requiring cancellations between the implicit and explicit mass-scale dependence of the parameters of the effective field theory. These results provide the justification for the treatment of the effective field theory as a local theory, uncoupled from the heavy-particle sector. We will present our results in the context of scalar theories with broken symmetry since, for these theories, the demonstration of uncoupling involves the greatest subtlety.},

  abstract = {With the discovery of the Higgs at the LHC, experiments have finally addressed all aspects of the Standard Model (SM). At this stage, it is important to understand which windows for beyond the SM (BSM) physics are still open, and which are instead tightly closed. We address this question by parametrizing BSM effects with dimension-six operators and performing a global fit to the SM. We separate operators into different groups constrained at different levels, and provide independent bounds on their Wilson coefficients taking into account only the relevant experiments. Our analysis allows to assert in a model-independent way where BSM effects can appear in Higgs physics. In particular, we show that deviations from the SM in the differential distributions of h-{$>$}Vff are related to other observables, such as triple gauge-boson couplings, and are then already constrained by present data. On the contrary, BR(h-{$>$} Z+gamma) can still hide large deviations from the SM.},

  abstract = {There have been three attempts to date to establish foundations for the discipline of probability, namely the efforts of Kolmogorov (frequentist), de Finetti (Bayesian: belief and betting odds) and RT Cox (Bayesian: reasonable expectation)/ET Jaynes (Bayesian: optimal information processing). The original "proof" of the validity of the Cox-Jaynes approach has been shown to be incomplete, and attempts to date to remedy this situation are themselves not entirely satisfactory. Here we offer a new axiomatization that both rigorizes the Cox-Jaynes derivation of probability and extends it - from apparent dependence on finite additivity to (1) countable additivity and (2) the ability to simultaneously make uncountably many probability assertions in a logically-internally-consistent manner - and we discuss the implications of this work for statistical methodology and applications. This topic is sharply relevant for statistical practice, because continuous expression of uncertainty - for example, taking the set \$\textbackslash Theta\$ of possible values of an unknown \$\textbackslash theta\$ to be \$(0,1)\$, or \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\$, or the space of all cumulative distribution functions on \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\$ - is ubiquitous, but has not previously been rigorously supported under at least one popular Bayesian axiomatization of probability. The most important area of statistical methodology that our work has now justified from a Cox-Jaynes perspective is Bayesian non-parametric inference, a topic of fundamental importance in applied statistics. We present two interesting foundational findings, one of which is that Kolmogorov's probability function \$\textbackslash mathbb\{P\}\_K (A)\$ of the single argument A is isomorphic to a version of the Cox-Jaynes two-argument probability map \$\textbackslash mathbb\{P\}\_\{CJ\} (A \textbackslash mid B)\$ in which Kolmogorov's B has been "hard-wired at the factory" to coincide with his sample space \$\textbackslash Omega\$, thus Kolmogorov is a special case of Cox-Jaynes.},

The number of light neutrino species is determined to be 2.9840+/-0.0082. The results are compared to the predictions of the Standard Model. Electroweak radiative corrections beyond the running of the QED and QCD coupling constants are observed with a significance of five standard deviations, and in agreement with the Standard Model. Of the many Z-pole measurements, the forward-backward asymmetry in b-quark production shows the largest difference with respect to its Standard Model expectation, at the level of 2.8 standard deviations. Through radiative corrections evaluated in the framework of the Standard Model, the masses of the top quark and the W Boson are predicted. These indirect constraints are compared to the direct measurements, providing a stringent test of the Standard Model.

Clear evidence for the production of a neutral boson with a measured mass of 126.0 +/- 0.4(stat) +/- 0.4(sys) GeV is presented. This observation, which has a significance of 5.9 standard deviations, corresponding to a background fluctuation probability of 1.7x10\^-9, is compatible with the production and decay of the Standard Model Higgs boson.},

Results are obtained by applying the method of direct reconstruction of the mass of the W from its decay products in both the W+W- -{$>$} lvqq and W+W- -{$>$} qqqq channels.

Averages are derived for di-fermion cross sections and forward-backward asymmetries, photon-pair, W-pair, Z-pair, single-W and single-Z cross sections, electroweak gauge boson couplings, W mass and width and W decay branching ratios. An investigation of the interference of photon and Z-boson exchange is presented, and colour reconnection and Bose-Einstein correlation analyses in W-pair production are combined. The main changes with respect to the experimental results presented in 2005 are new preliminary combinations of final \{\textbackslash LEPII\} results on the mass and width of the W boson. Including the precision electroweak measurements performed at the Z pole published recently, the results are compared with precise electroweak measurements from other experiments, notably CDF and D\{\textbackslash O\}at the Tevatron. Constraints on the input parameters of the Standard Model are derived from the results obtained in high-\$Q\^2\$ interactions, and used to predict results in low-\$Q\^2\$ experiments, such as atomic parity violation, M\{\textbackslash "o\}ller scattering, and neutrino-nucleon scattering.},

  abstract = {We define "constructed observables" as relating experimental measurements to terms in a Lagrangian while simultaneously making assumptions about possible deviations from the Standard Model (SM), in other Lagrangian terms. Ensuring that the SM effective field theory (EFT) is constrained correctly when using constructed observables requires that their defining conditions are imposed on the EFT in a manner that is consistent with the equations of motion. Failing to do so can result in a "functionally redundant" operator basis and the wrong expectation as to how experimental quantities are related in the EFT. We illustrate the issues involved considering the \$\textbackslash rm S\$ parameter and the off shell triple gauge coupling (TGC) verticies. We show that the relationships between \$h \textbackslash rightarrow V \textbackslash bar\{f\} \textbackslash, f\$ decay and the off shell TGC verticies are subject to these subtleties, and how the connections between these observables vanish in the limit of strong bounds due to LEP. The challenge of using constructed observables to consistently constrain the Standard Model EFT is only expected to grow with future LHC data, as more complex processes are studied.},

  abstract = {It is well-known but sometimes overlooked that constraints on the oblique parameters (most notably \$S\$ and \$T\$ parameters) are only applicable to a special class of new physics scenarios known as universal theories. In the effective field theory (EFT) framework, the oblique parameters should not be associated with Wilson coefficients in a particular operator basis, unless restrictions have been imposed on the EFT so that it describes universal theories. We work out these restrictions, and present a detailed EFT analysis of universal theories. We find that at the dimension-6 level, universal theories are completely characterized by 16 parameters. They are conveniently chosen to be: 5 oblique parameters that agree with the commonly-adopted ones, 4 anomalous triple-gauge couplings, 3 rescaling factors for the \$h\^3\$, \$hff\$, \$hVV\$ vertices, 3 parameters for \$hVV\$ vertices absent in the Standard Model, and 1 four-fermion coupling of order \$y\_f\^2\$. All these parameters are defined in an unambiguous and basis-independent way, allowing for consistent constraints on the universal theories parameter space from precision electroweak and Higgs data.},

  abstract = {Until recently precision electroweak computations were fundamentally uncertain due to lack of knowledge about the existence of the Standard Model Higgs boson and its mass. For this reason substantial calculational machinery had to be carried along for each calculation that changed the Higgs boson mass and other parameters of the Standard Model. Now that the Higgs boson is discovered and its mass is known to within a percent, we are able to compute reliable semi-analytic expansions of electroweak observables. We present results of those computations in the form of expansion formulae. In addition to the convenience of having these expressions, we show how the approach makes investigating new physics contributions to precision electroweak observables much easier.},

This is different to the choice made by BaBar in PRL 95, 121802 (2005) and arXiv:hep-ex/0507101, and requires additional computation. This Note explains Belle's choice using a related but simpler example: the averaging of two numbers. We find that intervals calculated with likelihood ratio ordering reproduce the analytic solution to this problem, whereas intervals calculated by ordering according to the p.d.f. (so-called Neyman intervals) do not, and show a pathology which is important in our case. This document is adapted from a Belle Internal Note.},
