% \emph{"The King is dead, long live the King!"}. Idea of the quote: the Standard Model is dead but, unlike French monarchs, sadly lives on forever. What a conundrum.


All the big picture stuff: constraints on New Physics from high precision measurements, a small nod to matter-antimatter asymmetry questions etc. 


This thesis places itself at the forefront of the latter effort, presenting the World's most precise measurement of the \CP-violating phase $\gamma$; a fundamental parameter in the Standard Model, in which it describes the sole source of matter-antimatter asymmetries. 

%Do mention the Belle~\cite{BelleCombo} and BaBar~\cite{BabarCombo} combinations of $\gamma$ measurements, including which decay channels they include (maybe).


Naturally, the work presented here is far from the last word on the value of $\gamma$. In the very near future, several important results will be updated by the \lhcb collaboration, based on the full data set collected during Run~2 of the LHC. In the slightly longer term, both the \lhcb and Belle~II collaborations expect to collect data samples of \B decays that are orders of magnitudes larger than the current ones during the coming decade, pushing the obtainable precision on $\gamma$ towards, even below, one degree. An outlook towards this exciting future of \CP-violation measurements is given in Chapter~\ref{ch:6-conclusion}, along with a summary of the contributions made in the present thesis.
